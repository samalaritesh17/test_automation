# test_automation

This is a basic testing which was done by me induvidually.
I used an e-commerce web application in order to perform the testing in it.
I have used selenium web driver, TestNG, Junit to automate the testing process.
I have tested some of the features in the web applications such as 
1.Login in
2.Add prodcuts to the cart
3.Filling out address details
4.Place the order

All the test cases have passed successfully.
